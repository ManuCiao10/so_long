# so_long

## Introduction
In this project, we'll code a simple 2D game to get familiar with the mlx library and UI in general.

### Game Rules
The game we choose must follow a set of rules. The executable ``so_long`` will receive a map as the only argument, and this map will have a ``.ber`` filetype.

## How it Works
For the graphics part of the project we used a library called ``minilibx``. It's fairly basic and somewhat limited, but was still fun to use in the project.
